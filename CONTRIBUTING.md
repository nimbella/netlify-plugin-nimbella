## Contributing to the Nimbella Plugin for Netlify

This document outlines the process for contributing to the Nimbella Plugin for Netlify. It also provides some specific guidance for code contributions.

- We have a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please review it so you are familiar with the project values.

### Issues

The easiest way to contribute is to open an issue with a bug report or a suggestion for improvement.   We do not have a prescriptive issue template.  We merely request that you take the time to communicate clearly so that we can understand what is being requested and respond appropriately.

- For bug reports, give as much detail as you can about exactly what you were doing when the problem occurred and use transcripts or screen shots to show the problematic behavior.
- For enhancement requests, give the context.  Ideally, explain why the Nimbella community would be interested in the improvement.  Then, be as explicit as you can about how you see the change looking and behaving.
- Check other open issues and add comments to existing issues rather than creating duplicates.

### Contributions of source code

All such contributions should be in the form of pull requests.  The exact format of the pull request description is not important but it should include

- _motivation_: what problem the contribution is trying to solve and why it should be regarded as helpful
- _externals_: what visible changes to the behavior of the plugin will occur if the pull request is merged
- (optionally) _internals_: anything that will help orient a reviewer in reading the code.

By opening a pull request

- You agree that your contributions will be licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE).
- When you open a pull request with your contributions, **you are certifying that you wrote the code** in the corresponding patch pursuant to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](#developer-certificate-of-origin) included below for your reference.
- You must conform to our style guidelines and tests must all pass. Issue `npm run lint` and fix any errors or warnings before submitting. A pre-commit hook is configured to run all tests.
